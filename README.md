# Path generators

This project contains Python 3 functions to make generators that yield file paths by traversing a directory tree or a
file with a list of paths.

This is something I have had laying around in my Dropbox for some time, but now when i need it for work, I felt that
I should publish it as open source software, such that I can refer to it henceforth.

I am still unsure whether I will publish this to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Throw me an issue if you think I should.
